          Goal: Create a drawing app with various basic tools that the user can
          access with instruction to enable easy use Paint/pencil tool Multiple
          color options Eraser + full clear tool Polygon tool Amount of sides,
          side length, and location Sizing Size and location Xlarge, large,
          medium, small, xtra small So many shades!! From reds to grays to
          almost all! Pink! Instruction tutorial for easy access Accessible GUI
          First time using Snap and debugging was necessary

        <p>
          Spent the summer learning and analyzing what Python is using the META
          provided course Some key takeaways Type Casting & Data Types: Learning
          how to use implicit and explicit casting to ensure accurate data
          handling, with experience in manipulating strings, integers, and
          floats. Flow Control & Loops: Practical experience with control flow
          structures like if-else, elif, for loops, and while loops, enabling
          dynamic decision-making and efficient iteration over data. Functions &
          Scope: Understanding how Python functions work with different scopes
          (local, global, enclosing) to manage variables and logic effectively.
          Algorithms: Gaining knowledge in designing step-by-step algorithms to
          solve problems and implement Pythonic solutions. Data Structures:
          Familiar with organizing data using Python’s lists, sets, and
          dictionaries, including hands-on lab exercises for manipulating data.
          Error Handling & File Operations: Learned to handle exceptions such as
          FileNotFoundError and work with file reading and writing using
          Python’s built-in open() function.
